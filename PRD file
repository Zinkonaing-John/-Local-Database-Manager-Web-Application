Product Requirements Document: Local Database Manager Web Application
1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a web-based application designed to provide users with a user-friendly interface to manage their local database instances. The primary goal is to empower users with full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) capabilities, coupled with a beautiful and intuitive user experience. For the purpose of this web application, "local database" refers to client-side data storage within the user's browser, specifically utilizing IndexedDB. This approach ensures a self-contained, browser-based solution without requiring external server setups.

2. Goals
To provide a simple, intuitive, and visually appealing interface for managing structured data.

To enable users to perform fundamental CRUD operations on their local IndexedDB databases.

To offer a responsive design that works seamlessly across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

To ensure data persistence within the user's browser, allowing them to return to their data.

To minimize the learning curve for users unfamiliar with direct database interaction.

3. Target Audience
Developers/Students: Who need a quick and easy way to prototype data structures or manage small datasets locally without setting up a full backend.

Small Businesses/Individuals: Who require a simple, offline-capable tool for managing inventories, contacts, tasks, or other structured information.

Casual Users: Who want to organize personal data in a structured format.

4. Features
4.1. Core Features
Database Management:

Ability to create new IndexedDB databases.

Ability to open/select existing IndexedDB databases.

Ability to delete existing IndexedDB databases.

Object Store (Table) Management:

Ability to create new object stores (equivalent to tables) within a selected database, defining key paths and auto-increment settings.

Ability to view a list of existing object stores in the current database.

Ability to delete object stores.

Data CRUD Operations:

Create (Add Record): Intuitive forms to add new records (objects) to a selected object store.

Read (View Data):

Display data from a selected object store in a clear, paginated table format.

Allow sorting of data by column headers.

Implement basic filtering/searching capabilities across record fields.

Update (Edit Record): Ability to select an existing record and modify its fields via an editable form.

Delete (Remove Record): Ability to select and delete one or more records from an object store.

User Interface:

Clean, modern, and responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

Clear navigation between databases, object stores, and data views.

Visual feedback for all operations (e.g., success messages, error alerts).

4.2. Advanced (Future) Features
Import/Export data (e.g., JSON, CSV).

Schema visualization.

Basic query builder (e.g., filtering by multiple criteria).

Dark mode toggle.

5. User Stories
As a user, I want to create a new database so I can start organizing my data.

As a user, I want to create a new object store (e.g., "Products") within my database so I can define a category for my data.

As a user, I want to add new product records (e.g., name, price, quantity) to my "Products" object store.

As a user, I want to view all my product records in a table so I can easily see my inventory.

As a user, I want to sort my products by name or price so I can quickly find what I'm looking for.

As a user, I want to search for a specific product by its name so I don't have to scroll through a long list.

As a user, I want to edit an existing product's details (e.g., update its quantity) so my data stays accurate.

As a user, I want to delete a product record when it's no longer needed.

As a user, I want the application to look good and be easy to use on my mobile phone.

6. Technical Requirements
Frontend Framework: Next.js

Styling: Tailwind CSS for all styling.

Database: IndexedDB API for client-side data storage.

State Management: React Context API or Zustand for application state.

Browser Compatibility: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

No External Backend: The application must function entirely client-side.

No alert() or confirm(): Use custom modal components for user feedback.

Responsiveness: Fully adaptive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints.

7. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Fast loading times.

Smooth UI transitions and data rendering, even with moderate datasets.

Usability:

Intuitive navigation and clear information hierarchy.

Minimal steps to perform common operations.

Clear error messages and success notifications.

Security (Client-side context):

No sensitive data should be stored in plain text if not strictly necessary (though IndexedDB is client-side, general good practices apply).

Input validation to prevent malformed data entry.

Scalability (Client-side context):

Designed to handle a reasonable number of databases and object stores (e.g., dozens).

Designed to handle thousands of records per object store without significant performance degradation.

8. Future Considerations
Data Visualization: Basic charts or graphs to represent data trends.

User Authentication (if extended): Integration with a simple authentication mechanism if data needs to be synced or shared (beyond the scope of "local IndexedDB").

Theming: User-selectable themes (e.g., light/dark mode).

Advanced Querying: More sophisticated filtering and querying options.
